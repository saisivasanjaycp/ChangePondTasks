ANGULAR :

-- Angular is a TypeScript-based(advanced version of javascript) open-source web application framework developed and maintained by Google
-- It is a platform for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript.
-- Angular provides a comprehensive solution for web development, offering tools, libraries, and powerful 
   features for building dynamic, robust, and scalable applications.

When to Use React or Angular?
Use React if:
-----------------
--You want flexibility and control over libraries and tools.
--Your project is focused on dynamic and interactive UI.
--You prefer simplicity and faster performance for small to medium-scale apps.

Use Angular if:
-----------------
--You want a comprehensive framework with built-in tools.
--Your project is enterprise-grade with complex requirements.
--You prefer strong typing and structured coding practices.

Pre- requiste Software Check
----------------------------------
==> nodejs = node --version
==> TypeScript = -ts 
==> Angular = -angular


How to create and install Angular
--------------------------------------
==> ng --version                 //display version of angualr
==> npm install -g @angular/cli  // it will create angular project
==> ng new projectName           // create name for angular project

Angular Work on component
---------------------------
component -- It is partial part of angular project
          -- it contain code for angular project.
          -- it can be any part of project,which  we can use multiple time
          -- in angular root component name is app           

How to create component in angular
----------------------------------
==> ng -g c componentName  (or)  ng generate componentname    

when we crate componet in angualr it generate four file
    1. HTML
    2. css
    3. TypeScript
    4. spec.ts 

creating components
-------------------
ng g c databinding
ng g c directive

How to get output of individual component
---------------------------------------------
-- Go to component ts file and copy its selector name and write as tag where you want

databinding
-------------
-- Getting or accessing data from one file to another file in same component
    1. interpolation{{}}: it send data from ts file ==> html file
    2. Property binding(): in this we set attribute (property) value ts ==> html
    3. event binding (): in this we sent data from html => ts file
    4. two-way databinding [()]= in this we can send data from ts to html
                            -- to perfrom two-way databinding we have ng model directory but ngmodel directive
                             is not part of core angular module it is part formsmodule, for this first we have 
                             to import form module in app.ts file import array.ts file in import array.


Directive in angular :
-----------------------
-- it is used to change appearance and behaviour as well as perform DOM manipulation in angular
-- there are three types of directives in angular
    1. Structural directive -- it is used to perform DOM manipulation in angular
                            -- Structural directive denoted by *
                            -- Structural directive are *ngIf, *ngFor, *ngSwitchCase
                            -- we can apply one directive at a time to single element
                            -- it is part of common module for this we have to import commonModule in component
             ng-template -- display out on the basis of condition
                         -- to create reference variable in angular we use #
                
    2. attribute directive --it is use to cahnge appearance and behaviour of DOM
                  -ngStyle-- it is used to apply css style property on the basic of condition
                  -ngClass-- it is used to apply css class on the basis of condition
                  -ngModel-- it is use to perform two-way binding

    3. custom directive -- the directive created by developer 
                        ==> ng g directive directivename

Component interaction:
-------------------------
accessing data from parent componentto child component
- Input() decorator: it is use to send data from parent component to child component
- output() decorator : it is use to send data from child component to parent component  

pipes:
----------
--it is use to  transform property value without changing its original value
--it is denoted by | single
--there are three types of pipe in angular
         1. Inbuilt pipe : pipe provided by angular
         2. Custom pipe : pipe create by developer for particular use
         3. third pipe : pipes already devloped by third party vender, first we have to install it and use it

How to install bootstrap in angular
----------------------------------
==> npm i bootstrap 
==> go to angular.json file and in its style array  import its path
==> restart angular project


Layout Folder 
---------------------
nav,pagenotfound,maindashboard,footer,login

Form Folder
-------------------
 angform,utdf,rtf    

 Routing in angular
 ---------------------
 - navigation of component
 - to display component output or navigating component by using routing in angular for it we write code
   in app.routes.ts.file

1. naming routing
2. default routing
3. redirect routing
4. parametrize routing
5. child routing
6. wildcard routing

How to navigate in angular:
--to perform component navigating we have to use routerlink property with anchor tag, 
but first we have to import routerlink in component ts file form "@react/router" library.


ANGULAR FORM 
--there are two types of forms 

1. UTFD ==> User template Deriven Form
    -- when we have to create simple form validation in that case we use it
    --to perform validation we have to use ngmodel directory with input element
    --int this ng form directory will hold data of all input element in it
    --in utdf form validation code reside in html file

2.RTF ==> Reactive template Form
    --when we have to write complex logic to perform form validation in that case we use it 
    --to use rtf form validation first we have to import reactiveformmodule from FormsModule in component
    --in this mainly two classes
            1. form group==>it will hold information of all input element
            2. formcontrol==>it will hold information of individual input element

Service in Angular
-----------------
--in angular service is special class with extra powser
--it is use for multiple users 
    1. to share data with multiple component
    2.we can implement business logic in it
    3.we can perform external communication(database connection)

How to create Service
------------------------
ng g service serviceName
ng g service shared/services/itemservices

how to access data from service into angular component
-----------------------------------------------------
-- if you want to service data into angular for this first we have to import service in 
    component ts file and create instance of service class 


REST FAEKE API 
-----------------
-CRUD

cd src/app/shared/database
json-server --watch -p -8888 db.json

how to make api reaquest from angular to services
------------------------------------------------------
-- to send requests from angular service to server for this we have create instance of HTTPclient class 
in service constructor, but HttpClient class in not part of HttpClientModule, s
o first we have to import HttpClientModule module.

so we have to import HttpClientModule.

ng g c crud/Productdash
ng g c crud/Productadd
ng g c crud/Productedit
*Consurrent Library:
"json-server" : "cd src/app/shared/database && npx json-server --watch -p 8888 db.json"
"start-dev" : "npx concurrently \"ng serve -o\"\"npm run json-server\"",



*guard : inangular guard is used to prevent rendering of routing compnent.
        -it return boolean value wither trur or false
        -if it return true then component will render otherwise not

    => ng g guard guardname


http-anular-server
npm isntall -g angular-http-server


*testing in angular
ng test
